🏦 Renaissance Bank Management System

This is a Python-based console application designed to simulate the core functionalities of a modern bank using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

Key Features:

Secure Account Management: Creation of new accounts with unique 6-digit IDs, secured by a password.

Authentication: Robust login system verifying name, account number, and password.

Financial Transactions: Functions for depositing and withdrawing funds.

Risk Mitigation: Includes mandatory "Insufficient Funds Check" logic for withdrawals.

Stability: Implements robust try-except input validation for all user inputs.

The system is built entirely in Python 3 and focuses on demonstrating a scalable OOP model. Data is currently stored in memory.

To Run:

Save the project code as bank_system.py.

Execute in your terminal: python bank_system.py.

Future plans include database integration for data persistence and a GUI upgrade.
